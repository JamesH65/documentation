# Monitor Connection

For regular use, you'll want to plug the Raspberry Pi in to a visual display: a monitor or a TV.

## HDMI Port

The Raspberry Pi has a HDMI port which you can plug directly into a monitor or TV with an HDMI cable. This is the easiest solution; some modern monitors and TVs have HDMI ports, and some do not, but there are other options.

### DVI

For monitors with a DVI port, you can use an HDMI-to-DVI cable, or an HDMI cable with a DVI adapter. Note that the DVI standard does not support audio.

### VGA

For monitors with VGA only, you can use an HDMI-to-VGA adapter.

## Composite Port

All models of Raspberry Pi have a composite out port for connecting to analog devices, but the type of connector depends on the model. The original Raspberry Pi 1 used an RCA connector, and a standard RCA composite video lead will work. Others models (Raspberry Pi B+ and later) combine the audio out and composite out on to the same jackplug. This requires a particular lead type, with audio left on the tip, audio right on ring 1, ground on ring 2 and video on the sleeve. This is the same as leads used on the Zune, and Apple devices.
